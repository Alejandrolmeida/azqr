### Event Grid

Event Grid resource definitions for topics, system topics, domains, and event subscriptions and event data are automatically replicated across three availability zones (when available) in the region. When there's a failure in one of the availability zones, Event Grid resources automatically failover to another availability zone without any human intervention.
