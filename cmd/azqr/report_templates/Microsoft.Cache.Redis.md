### Azure Cache for Redis

We recommend the use Azure Cache for Redis Premium or Enterprise tiers which support zone redundant configurations. A zone redundant cache can place its nodes across different Azure Availability Zones in the same region. It eliminates datacenter or AZ outage as a single point of failure and increases the overall availability of your cache.
