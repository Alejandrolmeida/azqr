### Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB provides high availability in two primary ways. First, Azure Cosmos DB replicates data across regions configured within a Cosmos account. Second, Azure Cosmos DB maintains 4 replicas of data within a region.
Azure Cosmos DB provides geo-replication and support for availability zones. We recommend at least the use of AZ.
